# JAVA NOTES:

## How It Works:
App (code) is independent from OS, but JVM is not.

JAVA CODE -> Compiler (javac) -> BYTE CODE -> JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE (JVM) -> OS -> HARDWARE
                                  class     JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT (JRE)
                                             JRE: Required for libraries

JVM: It requires a main method -> public static void main(String a[])

As a developer: Installing JDK :: JRE :: JVM
As a user: Installng JRE :: JVM

## Data Types:
1. Primitive
    1. Integer -> byte, short, int, long
        int   - 4 bytes
        long  - 8 bytes -> long num = 3444l
        short - 2 bytes
        byte  - 1 byte -> -2^7 to 2^7 -1 -> -128 to 127

    2. Float -> double, float
        float  - 4 bytes -> float  num = 5.6f;
        double - 8 bytes -> double num = 5.6;

    3. Character -> char *UNICODE*
        char - 2 bytes -> *IMPORTANT: SINGLE QUOTE* char c = 'k'

    4. Boolean -> true or false
        bool c = true;
    
2. ?

## Literals 
Literal: Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called literal/constant. 

In simple words, Literals in Java is a synthetic representation of boolean, numeric, character, or string data. It is a medium of expressing particular values in the program, such as an integer variable named ‘’/count is assigned an integer value in the following statement.

## Type Conversion and Casting
You may convert if a dat type can be contained by another one (byte -> int), you may lose some info though?
